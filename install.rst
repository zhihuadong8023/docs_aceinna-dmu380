    The required example will be imported into working directory in folder:

    C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\platformio\\Projects\\ProjectName

    Now you can edit, build and test the project. All your changes will remain in the above-mentioned directory and subdirectories.
    Next time when you return to development - open Aceinna "Home" page and click "Open Project", choose "Projects" and select
    required project from the list.

    The source tree of imported project tree has the following structure:

    ::

        project directory -|
                           |
                           |

                           |


-  **Compile and JTAG Code Loading**

    Once you have imported an example project, a good first step is to compile and download this application using your ST-LINK.
    At the bottom of the VS Code window is the shortcut toolbar shown below.  To load an application to the OpenIMU with JTAG,
    simply click the Install/Download button while the ST-LINK is connected to your EVB.

    The OpenIMU development environment uses PlatformIO's powerful open-source builder and IDE.  This on-line manual focuses on
    on OpenIMU specific information, and it does not attempt to fully discuss all of the IDE's powerful features in depth. For more information on PlatformIO builder and IDE features include command line interface, scripting and more please see the
    `PlatformIO  <https://docs.platformio.org>`__

.. _Ubuntu:

 **ST-LINK Install for Ubuntu (Manual Version)**

    Go to https://github.com/texane/stlink and read instructions carefully.

    On local Ubuntu machine, you will clone the aforementioned repository and make the project.  This requires
    the following packages to be installed:

        * CMake > v2.8.7
        * Gcc compiler
        * Libusb v1.0

    .. code:: bash

        # Run from source directory stlink/
        $make release
        $cd build/Release
        $sudo make install

        # Plug ST-LINK/V2 into USB, and check the device is present
        $ls /dev/stlink-v2
