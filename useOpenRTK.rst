How to use OpenRTK?
===================

The OpenRTK module acts as a NTRIP client fetching GNSS corrections data
from a NTRIP server of a GNSS correction service provider. This connectivity
requires the OpenRTK module sending out its current position via NMEA GGA 
every one second to the NTRIP server over the internet.
