RTK Network
===========

Aceinna Network provides high precision correction data in an open standard format (RTCM)
simply by connecting any GNSS-enabled devices over internet.  This correction data are 
used on the GNSS device to enhance its autonomous position even down to a centimetre. 
The advantages clearly outperform the old and complicated process of reference station 
setup and maintenance.
